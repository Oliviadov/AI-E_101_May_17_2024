### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, cross-platform, and open-sourced programming language released under a GPL-compatible license. He has become the language of choice for Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Developement, Image Processing, Game Developement, and Artificial Intelligence.
### Mandatory tools 
Before to start coding and programming with Python, some mandatory tools need to install, including:
• Python Miniconda with python 3.10, https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe/;
• Jupyter Notebook, https://jupyter.org/; 
• ChatGPT, https://chat.openai.com/; 
• PyCharm Community Edition, https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC/;
• Git, https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.44.0.windows.1/Git-2.44.0-64-bit.exe.
#### NB: To document my work, i'll continue in Pycharm.
### Keyword in Python
A computer programming language is made up of a set of predefined words called keywords. A prescribed usage rule for each keyword is called syntax. 
Here is some list of the Python keywords: (False, None, True, and, as, else, elif, if, in, is, while, etc). The global list of Python keywords can be obtained using the following help command. eg: help("keywords"). Enter any keyword to get more help. eg: help("while"). # NB: Except for the first three (False, None and True), the other keywords are entirely in lowercase.
### Python Variables
In Python, a variable is a container that stores a value. In other words, variable is the name given to a value, so that it becomes easy to refer to it later. eg: x = "Hello Olivia!" ; print(x). I'll have the output: Hello Olivia! # Explanation: Here the name of my variable is x and her value is "Hello Olivia!.
### Python data types
Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
We distinguish: (i) Scalar Types, including: *int: Positive or negative whole numbers (without a decimal part) eg: -10, 10, 4, 5, 3554714; *float: Any real number with a decimal part. eg: 1.53, 8.455; *bool: Data with one of two built-in values True or False; *None: The None represents the null object in Python. A None is returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value; *complex: A number with a real and imaginary component represented as x + 3y.
(ii) Sequence Type, including: *String: A string value is a collection of one or more characters put in single('), double(") or triple quotes(''').; *List: A list object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessarily of the same type, put in square brackets []; *Tuple: A Tuple object is an ordered collection of one or more data items, not necessarily of the same type, put in parentheses().
(iii) Mapping Type: *Dictionary: A dictionary Dict() object is an unordered collection of data in a key:value pair form. A collection of such pairs is enclosed in curly brackets. For example: {1:"Brian", 2:"Bill", 3:"Ram", 4: "Lucas"}.
*NB: Numbers, strings, and Tuples are immutable, which means their contents can't be altered after creation. On the other hand, items in a List or Dictionary object can be modified. It is possible to add, delete, insert, and rearrange items in a list or dictionary.
