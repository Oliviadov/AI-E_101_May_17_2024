# Arithmetic_operators
# Python operators : Arithm√©tic operators Arithmetic operators perform the common mathematical operation on the numeric operands.
# The arithmetic operators return the type of result depends on the type of operands, as below.
# Addition +: Sum of two operands
x, y = 5, 6
print(x + y) # output: 11

# Subtraction -: Left operand minus right operand
print(x - y) # -1

# Multiplication *: Left operand multiply by right operand
print(x * y)  output: 30

# Exponentiation ** : Left operand raised to the power of right
x = 2
y = 3
print(2 ** 3) # output: 8

# Division /
x = 6
y = 3
print(x/ y) # output: 2.0

# Floor division // # Sends the quotient rounded down to the lower integer
x = 6
y = 5
print(x // y) # output: 1

# Modulus: Reminder of a/b % to see if a number is even. if x%y == 0, x is even
x = 11
y = 3
print(x % y) # output: 2 (x is not even)
x=16
y=4
print(x % y) # output 0 (x is even)
