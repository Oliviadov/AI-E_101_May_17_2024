WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
MANDATORY TOOLS
To work with Python, you typically need the following tools:
Python Interpreter: The software that executes Python code. It can be downloaded from the official Python website.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Tools like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebooks enhance productivity with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion.
Package Manager: pip is the package installer for Python, used to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies.
Text Editor: While IDEs are more robust, text editors like Sublime Text or Atom can also be used for Python development.
KEYWORD IN PYTHON
Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used for variable names. Examples include if, else, while, for, def, class, try, except, finally, and import.

PYTHON VARIABLE
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. You can assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=). Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore and can include letters, numbers, and underscores.

x = 10
name = "Alice"
PYTHON DATA TYPE
Python supports several data types, including:

Numeric Types: int, float, complex
Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
Text Type: str
Mapping Type: dict
Set Types: set, frozenset
Boolean Type: bool
Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
PYTHON OPERATORS
Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

python
Copier le code
a + b  # Addition
a - b  # Subtraction
a * b  # Multiplication
a / b  # Division
a % b  # Modulus
a ** b # Exponentiation
a // b # Floor division
Assignment Operators
These operators are used to assign values to variables.

python
Copier le code
a = 5
a += 3  # a = a + 3
a -= 3  # a = a - 3
a *= 3  # a = a * 3
a /= 3  # a = a / 3
a %= 3  # a = a % 3
a **= 3 # a = a ** 3
a //= 3 # a = a // 3
Comparison Operators
These operators compare two values.

python
Copier le code
a == b  # Equal
a != b  # Not equal
a > b   # Greater than
a < b   # Less than
a >= b  # Greater than or equal to
a <= b  # Less than or equal to
Logical Operators
These operators combine conditional statements.

python
Copier le code
a and b
a or b
not a
Identity Operators
These operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

python

a is b
a is not b
STRINGS
A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed within single ('), double ("), or triple quotes (''' or """).

String Methods
Python provides several methods to manipulate strings.

python
Copier le code
s = "Hello, World!"
s.lower()       # 'hello, world!'
s.upper()       # 'HELLO, WORLD!'
s.strip()       # removes whitespace
s.replace('H', 'J')  # 'Jello, World!'
s.split(',')    # ['Hello', ' World!']
Character Escaping
Special characters can be escaped using a backslash (\).

python
Copier le code
newline = "Hello\nWorld"
quote = "He said, \"Python is awesome!\""
fString
Formatted string literals (f-strings) provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}.

python
Copier le code
name = "Alice"
age = 30
f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old."
String Operators
Python supports various operators for string manipulation.

python
Copier le code
s1 + s2       # Concatenation
s * 3         # Repetition
'a' in s      # Membership
Regular Expression
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. Python's re module provides support for regular expressions.

python
Copier le code
import re
pattern = r'\d+'
re.findall(pattern, 'There are 123 apples')  # ['123']
LOOP
Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

while loop syntax
python
Copier le code
while condition:
    # code block
While Loop with else Block
The else block is executed when the loop condition becomes false.

python
Copier le code
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")
for loop
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).

python

for element in sequence:
    # code block
PYTHON FUNCTIONS
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

Math functions
Python provides built-in functions for mathematical operations.

python
Copier le code
abs(x)       # Returns the absolute value of x
pow(x, y)    # Returns x raised to the power of y
round(x)     # Rounds a number to nearest integer
Advanced math functions
For more complex mathematical functions, Python provides the math module.

python
Copier le code
import math
math.sqrt(16)        # 4.0, square root
math.factorial(5)    # 120, factorial
math.sin(math.pi/2)  # 1.0, sine
