### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, cross-platform, and open-sourced programming language released under a GPL-compatible license. He has become the language of choice for Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Developement, Image Processing, Game Developement, and Artificial Intelligence.
### Mandatory tools 
Before to start coding and programming with Python, some mandatory tools need to install, including:
• Python Miniconda with python 3.10, https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe/;
• Jupyter Notebook, https://jupyter.org/; 
• ChatGPT, https://chat.openai.com/; 
• PyCharm Community Edition, https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC/;
• Git, https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.44.0.windows.1/Git-2.44.0-64-bit.exe.
### Keyword in Python
A computer programming language is made up of a set of predefined words called keywords. A prescribed usage rule for each keyword is called syntax. 
Here is some list of the Python keywords: (False, None, True, and, as, else, elif, if, in, is, while, etc). The list of Python keywords can be obtained using the following help command. eg: help("keywords"). Enter any keyword to get more help. eg: help("while"). # NB: Except for the first three (False, None and True), the other keywords are entirely in lowercase.
### Python Variables
In Python, a variable is a container that stores a value. In other words, variable is the name given to a value, so that it becomes easy to refer to it later.
